Just a quick little update.

## 2024 Recap

2024 has been a pretty interesting year for me. As mentioned before, I have done a lot of "exploring" and have been picking up many new things, such as Java Spring and backend development which I have done very little before. Outside of tech, I've tried gardening and a little hiking, as I feel it's always good to connect with nature every once in a while.

## 2025 Theme

As much as I enjoyed trying out new things and learning all that life has to offer, I feel that I have been spreading myself out too thin. Everything I picked up at the start of the year has been set aside for others, and any physical items I bought have started collecting dust. Things have been pretty inconsistent and I see that there's room for improvement. So it shall be, the theme "Consistency" for this year. The focus will be to be consistent and disciplined in a few areas I want to work on, and if I ever pick up a new hobby, I will have to see if I can explore it long term, rather than hastily picking it up just to drop it a month later.

So now it's time to work on a plan on what I would like to stay consistent in, let's just hope I don't procrastinate on that for too long.
