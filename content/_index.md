Hi! I'm Matthew, a tech enthusiast passionate about efficiency, reliability and reproducibility.

### What I Do

I'm a **DevOps Engineer** with 5 years of professional experience in tech.  
My expertise includes:

-   **Programming / Coding**:  
    I have been coding since I was 13 years old, and have been improving ever since. I started of with simple batch scripts and picked up HTML and CSS later on. Over the years I have picked up a multitude of languages, such as Java, Javascript, Python, C, C++, and Rust. I enjoy learning new languages and its inner quirks that make it unique.
-   **DevOps & Cloud**:  
    I started my DevOps journey within my first year of working. I built an internal tool and was tasked with setting up a pipeline to run the tool automatically. Since then I have been learning concepts and the tools associated with DevOps and have been successfully implementing these processes across teams. These include but are not limited to:
    - CI/CD -- Azure Pipelines, GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
    - Containerization -- Docker, Podman
    - Container Orchestration -- Kubernetes
    - Secret Management -- Azure KeyVault
    - Artifcact Management -- Artifactory
-   **Linux & NixOS**:  
    I have been using Linux as my go-to operating system for software development for a few years now, and have not really looked back since. I have used Linux distributions such as Linux Mint and Ubuntu for desktop, and Debian and RHEL for servers. As of right now, I have been daily driving NixOS for over a year. NixOS uses a declarative configuration system and aligns with the **"Everything as Code"** philosophy.
